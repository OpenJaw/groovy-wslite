#### Important changes to note

* SOAPClient
 * responses now include both the HTTPRequest `response.httpRequest` and HTTPResponse `response.httpResponse`
 * `response.http` was changed to `response.httpResponse`
 * `response.Envelope` was changed to `response.envelope`
 * exceptions now include `httpRequest` and `httpResponse` objects.
 * a `SOAPFaultException` is now being thrown anytime there is a Envelope/Body/Fault element in the response.  The
 properties `faultcode/faultstring/faultactor/detail` have been removed (these only applied to SOAP 1.1 faults).
 Instead you can access the Fault via GPathResult using `soapFaultException.fault`.

* RESTClient
 * `response.XML -> response.xml`, `response.JSON -> response.json`, `response.TEXT -> response.text`
 * exceptions now include request/response objects (if available)

* Common
 * `trustAllSSLCerts` connection parameter renamed to `sslTrustAllCerts`
 *  New connection parameters `sslTrustStoreFile` and `sslTrustStorePassword` enable trusting SSL connection based on a
 custom trust store file (see SSL section of README)
 *  Requests no longer default to trusting all SSL certs.  You must set `sslTrustAllCerts` (see SSL section of README)

## 0.1 (2011-03-27)

* Initial release
